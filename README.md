![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/19j0ajP.png)

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive, practical introduction to modern
full-stack web development using JavaScript and Node.js. The course will start
with basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Then, we will move into Node.js and learn how to
deploy a website from there. We will learn about Express.js (server-side
development module) and MongoDB (database) in order to create a complete web
application.

## Grading
Grades will be maintained on the CS Department
[grades server](https://grades.cs.umd.edu/).

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted on the
class repository, including announcements, deadlines, policies, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:

| Percentage | Title | Description |
| ------------- | -----|-------- |
| 55% | Projects  | Weekly individual projects that teach practical skills and real life applications. |
| 20% | Midterm | Examination  |
| 25% | Final Project | Final project to demonstrate mastery of all topics learned and apply knowledge to create a new application from scratch. |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted
within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered
afterwards.

## Projects
Projects must be submitted electronically following the instructions given in
each project assignment. Projects may not be submitted by any other means
(e.g., please do not email your projects to us). It is your responsibility to
test your program and verify that it works properly before submitting. All
projects are due at 11:59 PM on the day indicated on the project assignment.

Projects may be submitted up to 24 hours late for a 10% penalty. If you submit
both on-time & late, your project will receive the maximum of the
penalty-adjusted scores. You may submit multiple times.

Unlike lower-level programming classes, we will not provide you with test cases
(e.g., public tests) before projects are due. You will be responsible for
developing your own tests and for using appropriate testing techniques. Also,
we expect your projects to use proper style and documentation.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We will interact with students outside of class in primarily two ways: online at [Piazza](piazza.com/umd/spring2018/cmsc389k/home) and office hours by appointment.
Email should only be used for emergencies and non-class related questions
(e.g. projects).

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic
dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all
submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to
the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of
Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit
